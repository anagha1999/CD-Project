x = 10
y = 30
z = x + 20 

Three Address Code - per statement it has
-> at most three addresses
-> ONE operator ONLY
-> INTERMEDIATE values at each instruction to be stored in a temp variable
t0 = 10
x = t0
t1 = 30
y = t1 
t2 = x
t3 = 20
t4 = t2 + t3
z = t4


Quads:
op 		arg1	arg2	res
=		10		- 		t0
=		t0		-		x
+		t2		t3		t4






Optimized:
x = 10
y = 30
t0 = x + 20
z = t0
